What is Flux?
--
Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. 
It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow. It's more 
of a pattern rather than a formal framework, and you can start using Flux immediately without a lot 
of new code.
